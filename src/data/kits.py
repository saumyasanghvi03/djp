            {"q": "I keep overthinking everything.", "a": "Name your thought → drop judgment → play *Chowk Puravo (Calm)*. Then we’ll place the thought in the ‘Temporary Cloud Box’ and let it float away."},
            {"q": "I can’t stay consistent.", "a": "Start with 10 minutes. That’s it. That’s your new rule. No shame, no comparisons."},
            {"q": "How do I feel lighter?", "a": "Try this: *Parmatma Bani Jase Maro Aatma*. Listen once. It resets identity — from stress → atma."},
            {"q": "I get irritated easily.", "a": "Anger = mind overheating. 3-breath cool-down → Nemji Shamaliya soft version → 1 act of kindness within next 2 hours."},

            {"q": "I can’t focus for even 5 minutes.", "a": "Switch to Jain LoFi mode: Navkar LoFi + Namami Nemi instrumental. The mind needs a softer soundwave."},
            {"q": "I wasted the whole day.", "a": "You didn’t waste it — your mind was tired. Start a 15-minute micro-session. We build from there."},
            {"q": "Exam stress is eating me up.", "a": "Activate Exam Mode → breath reset → Chintamani → 3-step study plan."},
            {"q": "I feel like I won’t do well.", "a": "Detach from results. Focus on next 20 minutes. That’s the Jain discipline — effort without fear."},
            {"q": "I don’t know what to study first.", "a": "Pick the easiest topic. Starting easy = motion. Motion kills anxiety."},
            {"q": "I’m studying but nothing is going into my head.", "a": "Your mind’s buffer is full. 5 minutes → listen *Nemras Soft*. Then resume."}

            {"q": "Why does it hurt so much?", "a": "Because your mind is detaching. Pain is part of release — not a sign of failure."},
            {"q": "I keep checking their profile.", "a": "Mute, hide, or block for 48 hours. That’s self-love, not ego."},
            {"q": "I miss them.", "a": "Missing someone is normal. But don’t chase memories. Listen to *Rome Rome Nemi No* and breathe."},
            {"q": "I feel rejected.", "a": "You didn’t get rejected — the situation got re-routed. Your worth didn’t change."},

            {"q": "I feel lonely at night.", "a": "Night magnifies emotions. Play *Nemras Night Mix* and sit with your breath. Loneliness becomes calm."},
            {"q": "Should I get into a talking stage just to feel something?", "a": "Don’t use people to fill gaps. Fill it with rituals, music, purpose — the right connection will come clean."},
